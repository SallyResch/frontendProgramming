        <h2>About our company</h2>
        <article>
            Our company provides a seamless digital bridge between different parking applications, making urban mobility easier and more connected. Instead of users having to switch between multiple apps, our platform integrates them into a single, unified experience.
            We specialize in aggregating real-time parking availability from various providers and presenting it in a consistent, user-friendly format. In addition, we enrich this information with clear indicators of whether parking locations offer charging options for both electric cars and e-bikes.
            By acting as the connector between fragmented parking and mobility services, we help cities, businesses, and end-users save time, reduce stress, and support the transition to sustainable transport. Whether you’re driving a car or cycling through town, our service ensures you know exactly where to park — and whether you can charge your vehicle when you arrive.
